 ## ABSTRACT _ START
 A back titration is a titration method where the concentration of an analyte is determined by reacting it with 
 a known amount of excess reagent. The remaining excess reagent is then titrated with another, second reagent.
 The second titration's result shows how much of
 the excess reagent was used in the first titration, thus allowing the original analyte's concentration to be calculated.

 ## ABSTRACT _ end 
 
<INTRO>
Titration is a common laboratory method of quantitative chemical analysis to determine the concentration of an identified analyte (a substance to be analyzed). A reagent, termed the titrant is prepared as a standard solution of known concentration and volume. The titrant reacts with a solution of analyte to determine the analyte's concentration. The volume of titrant that reacted with the analyte is termed the titration volume. 

back titration is used when the molar concentration of an excess reactant is known, but the need exists to determine the strength or concentration of an analyte.

Back titration is typically applied in acid-base titrations:

    When the acid or (more commonly) base is an insoluble salt (e.g., calcium carbonate)
    When direct titration endpoint would be hard to discern (e.g., weak acid and weak base titration)
    When the reaction occurs very slowly

 Two steps are typically followed in a back titration:

    The volatile analyte is permitted to react with an excess reagent
    A titration is conducted on the remaining quantity of the known solution

This is a way to measure the amount consumed by the analyte, thus calculate the excess quantity.

<\MATERIALS>
Aim : to determine the amount of pure CaCO3 in  white chalk
<Procedure> :
take a 5 grams of white chalk and crush it into a fine powder
-- make a solution of it with water

Prepare a standard m/10 solution of Hcl and m/10 soln. of Naoh

take 5g of the powdered chalk and add it to 20 ml of HCl
 
add a few drops of phrnalphthalein

take a burette and fill it with NaOH and titrate it with the chalk soln .
mixed with Hcl to find out excess amount of HCl 

with the amt of excss hcl we can find the amount of Ca CO3 we can find the
amount of CaCO3 in chalk

<\Procedure>
<REACTIONS>
CaCO3 + 2HCl -> CaCl2 + H2O
HCl + NaOH -> NaCl + H2O
<\REACTIONS>
<RESULT>
mass % of CaCO3 in Chalk by the method of backtitration
