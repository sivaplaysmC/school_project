we should have a display surface only tht will be displayed
we sould have a larger main surface in which all platforms will be blitted and everytime 
a player moves beyond the limit we wil use the pygame.rect.subsurface to move rightside
this way we can overcome the damn problem of moving rect objects
(important dont think the above line is wrong as the coloured platforms are not moving
what is used ther is a workaround . What i have done is i have drawn the platforms on 
the background surface which results in this illusion ^_^)
